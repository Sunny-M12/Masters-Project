# Masters-Project
The above shows my Final Year Project from the Data Science MSc from Loughborough University. The goal of this project was not only to showcase the skills learnt throughout the year - python, machine learning, report writing - but also to help aid with a classification problem using the UNSW-NB15 dataset as a base. 
The classification problem was in assessing whether or not a data-packet may be correctly identified as a DoS attack packet or not. Also, the project also aimed to uncover the best features, from the UNSW-NB15 dataset, in determining these attack packets.
The report was also a test of my ability to translate the results to an audience unfamiliar with the topic.
All feedback is appreciated!!

## How to Read
The ipynb files should be read alongside the report. Each ipynb is named after each Chapter in the report, i.e., the Chapter 1 ipynb file should be run, and then Chapter 1 from the report should be read.

## Future Goals
This was my very first project. As of writing this, the results have not been received yet but once received the feedback will be implemented to the code and report. The grade will also be added in the repository.
